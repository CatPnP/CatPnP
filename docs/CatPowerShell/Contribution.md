# Contributing to Catapult's Productivity PowerShell Repository

CatPnP is intended to be modeled after the broader community PnP GitHub repositories and the [Sharing is Caring](https://pnp.github.io/sharing-is-caring/) initiative. The intent is that if you are familiar with contributing to the broader community then you are also able to contribute to the Catapult community.

## Honor System

Catapult is leveraging the free version of GitHub which allows us to have unlimited contributors, but doesn't allow us to enforce approval on commits and pull requests. For this reason, when you are looking to fix something, add a new script or contribute in any fashion please create a fork of the repo to ensure that changes can be tracked and reviewed when merging.  GitHub will allow all of our contributors to approve their own pull requests also.  We ask users not to approve your own requests. We will try and review them as quickly as possible to ensure the goodness that you have contributed gets shared quickly & effectively with the rest of the organization.
